# Control-and-Automation
I recently finished my master's degree in engineering physics, however, my master's thesis of developing a Stewart Platform used to perform wave compensation aboard a ship made me realize Instrumentation, Control engineering and Automation is what I want to work in. With that said I will be building a portfolio, of sorts, comprised of simulations of control systems, automation simulations and real life projects and reports for each week of learning.
All projects built during this plan have their own separate directory. Additionally, there is also a directory that contains a report for each week.
