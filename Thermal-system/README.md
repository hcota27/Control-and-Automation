This directory contains a SIMULINK block diagram and MATLAB script of a closed loop thermal system.
The main purpose of this project was to compare open-loop and closed-loop systems. A Thermal system was designed to receive the current temperature output through feedback and with the use 
of a on-off controller shutdown the heater when the temperature is equal to the setpoint and turn it on again when it's lower than this setpoint.
